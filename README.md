# html-include-comment
Simply include html partials via html comments like this &lt;!-- header.html -->

# Install
`$ npm install html-include-comment`

# Usage
`$ html-include-comment some/source.html some/dest.html`

# Patterns

It works with both comment styles: `<!-- some/file.html -->` and `/* some/otherfile.css */`.

File type or extension does not matter.
